    "### PART 1: Prediction of player position given the position data\n",
    "   1. Acceleration, velocity, position, number of other player same types, player type, orientation, direction, and frametype with nflid (bool to drop data) as prediction parameters\n",
    "   2. Actual position after a set period as validation data\n",
    "   3. Will focus on predicting the position based on current movement end of snap state\n",
    "   4. K-means (or K-neighbors), and Random forest can be used\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Defensive Adjustment Prediction\n",
    "Build a model that anticipates how the defense will adjust to offensive pre-snap motions, given the predictions found in part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### New Idea\n",
    "Based on total movement/per-position movement/some other stuff can we predict if play type will be run or pass, how much win probabability will be added, likelihood of scoring, etc"
